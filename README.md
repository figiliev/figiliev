## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 I’m currently working on my **Computer Science degree at UCO**
- 🐢 I have built a **gamified degree tracker** using Python and turtle graphics — tracking classes by literally hitting them on screen!
- 🔭 Currently exploring **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** through a Techlahoma bootcamp.
- 🌱 Always learning something new — I code to *create*, not just complete.
- ☕ Most productive when the code’s clean and the mind's rested and the body strong after a run or Yoga.
